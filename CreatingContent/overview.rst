Creating Content
================

Creating content for the engine is entirely data driven.
The engine contains a number of pre-defined places where content can be setup for use as part of a project.
These most commonly include:

 - Script files
 - Maps defined in the maps directory

All of the content for the engine can be created by hand.
However tools exist to help the user create content.
Southsea is a tool specifically to design maps/levels for the engine, and should be investigated if you are looking to create or edit maps.
